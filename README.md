## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Minja, a Helsinki-based software developer with a fronte-end / full-stack focus, currently working as a software developer and actively learning new things about the fascinating world of front-end development, especially ReactJS, VueJS, NodeJS and others. When I'm not working on a project, you'll probably catch me enjoying the Finnish countryside with my horse ðŸ™‚
